Processed_Test_Data_Without_Countries.csv
Processed_Train_Data_Without_Countries.csv

The above two csv files were created for the semi - supervised methodology. The reason is that in the unlabeled dataset doesn't have any data for the countries
As a result the country column need to be removed from the training dataset as well as the test dataset
in order the unlabeled dataset and training/testing dataset to have the same exact columns

The preprocessing was initially done in Jupyter Notebook. The graphs created in Jupyter are much more easier to visualize
There is a folder called Jupyter files were the original .ipynb were the preprocessing was done are saved down
The .py file called 

Assignment_Data_Preprocessing_Test_Data.py
Assignment_Data_Preprocessing_Train_Data.py
Assignment_Data_Preprocessing_Unalbelled_Data.py

Were created for the sake of an easier review. Same exactly code is included
but the graphs might not be that clear
